# BrainTrainer
This is an android project that I did as a little game experiment in Android Studio.

I'm not the first person doing this but I tried to make a "brain trainer" game myself, as the college teacher that attends to my courses gave this as an homework.

It gives you randomized values with basic mathematic operations. Also there's a timer and a final score.
